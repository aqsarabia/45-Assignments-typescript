// / //Q25: Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a 
// // variable called alien_color and assign 
// // it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
var alien_color = "yellow";
// // • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is
// // , print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
if (alien_color == "yellow") {

// // • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
// //  (The version that fails will have no output.)
